                        </div>
                        <p id="my_answer">I can think of a time at my old job when I had to take the lead in a tricky
                            situation. We had this project where we had to launch a new product, and I was the project
                            manager.

                            <br><br>The catch was, we had a bunch of people with different skills and personalities on
                            the team. So, I had to step up and make things work:
                            <br><br>Set the Stage: I kicked things off with a team meeting, laying out what needed to be
                            done, who was responsible for what, and the tight timeline we had.
                            <br><br>Keep the Chat Flowing: I encouraged everyone to speak their minds and made sure
                            everyone felt heard. No idea was too small or too crazy.
                            <br><br>Deal with Drama: Of course, there were some disagreements. I jumped in to sort out
                            conflicts and find common ground among team members.
                            <br><br>In the end, we launched that new product right on schedule and didn't blow our
                            budget. This experience taught me that good leadership makes all the difference in getting a
                            project done well, even with a diverse team.

                        <p id="my_vocalPresence"><span>Volume: 4/5</span> - A higher, but still moderate, vocal level projects energy and engagement that captures attention. While the interviewee's current volume effectively conveys ideas, a bolder voice could lend additional authoritativeness and impact to the well-formulated responses.
                            <br><br><span>Speed: 5/5</span> - The interviewee exhibits an optimal cadence and pacing in their responses. Their rate of speech is measured and appropriate, facilitating easy comprehension.
                                <br><br><span>Tone: 3/5</span> - While conveying ideas clearly, the interviewee's vocal tone could reveal greater enthusiasm through expanded expressiveness. Adopting a wider vocal range and melodic modulation would further showcase the candidate's innate passion and engagement.
                                    <br><br><span>Precision of Language: 4/5</span> - The interviewee's consistently succinct, filler-free responses demonstrate exemplary preparation and command of language. Their judicious word selection reveals a keen understanding of the power of conciseness to convey maximum meaning.

                            <span>1. Relevance: 9/10</span> - The candidate’s response directly addresses the
                            interviewer’s question, describing a specific disagreement with a colleague and how it was
                            resolved.
                            <br><br><span>2. Specificity: 8/10</span> - The candidate provides sufficient details to
                            provide context for the disagreement, such as the different priorities each person had and
                            the compromise that was ultimately reached. However, there could have been more specific
                            examples of how the disagreement played out.
                            <br><br><span>3. Actions: 8/10</span> - The candidate articulates the steps they took to
                            address the situation, such as having an open debate and reaching a compromise. However, it
                            could have been clearer what specific actions the candidate took to contribute to the
                            resolution.
                            <br><br><span>4. Results and Impact: 8/10</span> - The candidate describes the positive
                            outcome of the disagreement, such as the compromise that was reached. However, there could
                            have been more discussion of the impact of the compromise and how it improved the work.
                            <br><br><span>5. Learning: 6/10</span> - While the candidate does not mention any major
                            mistakes or failures, they do not discuss any significant lessons learned from the
                            disagreement either.
                            <br><br><span>6. Clarity: 9/10</span> - The candidate's answer is easy to understand and
                            follow. The language used is clear and concise, and the response is well-structured.
                            <br><br><span>7. Soft skills: 9/10</span> - The candidate demonstrates several key soft
                            skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, in their description of how
                            they resolved the disagreement.

                            <br><br><span>Overall</span> - I would rate the answer a 8/10. The response provides a clear
                            and relevant example of a disagreement with a colleague and the steps taken to resolve it.
                            However, there could have been more specific examples and discussion of the impact of the
                            compromise, as well as any lessons learned from the situation. The candidate does, however,
                            demonstrate several key soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork,
                            making it a strong response overall.

                        </div>
                        <p id="my_revise">One of the most challenging aspects of this project was the team dynamics. We
                            had a diverse group of individuals with varying levels of expertise and different working
                            styles. As the project manager, it was my responsibility to ensure that everyone was aligned
                            with the project's objectives and working cohesively toward the common goal.
                            <br><br>Here's how I demonstrated leadership skills in this situation:
                            <br><br>Setting Clear Goals and Expectations: I started by holding a team meeting to outline
                            our project's objectives, scope, and timeline. I made sure everyone understood their roles
                            and responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of their contributions to the project's
                            success.
                            <br><br>Effective Communication: Throughout the project, I maintained open and transparent
                            communication channels. I encouraged team members to voice their ideas, concerns, and
                            questions. By fostering an environment of trust and open communication, I ensured that
                            everyone felt heard and valued.
                            <br><br>Conflict Resolution: As expected in any diverse team, conflicts arose. I addressed
                            conflicts promptly, facilitating productive discussions and finding solutions that were
                            acceptable to all parties involved. This helped maintain a positive working atmosphere.
                            <br><br>In the end, we successfully launched the new product on time and within budget. The
                            project's success was not only a testament to our collective efforts but also a reflection
                            of my ability to lead, inspire, and navigate a diverse team toward a common goal.
