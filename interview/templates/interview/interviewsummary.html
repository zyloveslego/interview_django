                    highlighted your abilities.
                    <br><br>On the question about describing a time you faced a challenge at work, you gave a detailed
                    account of how you approached the situation in a methodical way to uncover the root issues. You
                    showed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Your step-by-step explanation was easy to
                    follow.
                    <br><br>When asked about a time you failed and what you learned from it, you openly acknowledged the
                    failure and took responsibility for your part in it. You showed maturity in being able to reflect on
                    mistakes and describe specific lessons that will make you a more effective team member in the
                    future.
                    <br><br>Discussing your proudest professional achievement, you highlighted positive outcomes you

                    you are a skilled, reliable, and personable candidate who would thrive in a team environment. I have
