                    <p class="answer"> My day starts by rolling out of bed at 6:00am to make it to the gym before work - it's the only way I can squeeze in a workout! Then I'm out the door by 8:00am. The mornings are filled back-to-back with meetings - catching up with my VP to talk deal flow and new projects, then connecting with analysts on my team to delegate tasks and deadlines. We usually order lunch in and eat at our desks while working. The afternoons are focused more on financial modeling and company valuations. I'll hunker down and put together earnings projections, DCF models, comp analysis and other materials to support live deals. Of course there are phone calls with clients sprinkled throughout the day as issues come up. Most nights I'm out the door around 10pm. But when we have presentations or a live deal in the works, I've spent the night at the office more times than I can count. The hours are grueling but the work is fast-paced and intellectually stimulating. And everyone at Goldman is brilliant and smart, so I really enjoy the people too. I'm hoping the hard work pays off and I make MD in the next few years!</p>
