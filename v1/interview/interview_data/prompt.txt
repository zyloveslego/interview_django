"question": "Describe a time when you had a disagreement with your colleague?",
"answer": "Let me tell you about a disagreement I had with a colleague recently at work. We were working together on developing a new product roadmap and had different views on what the priorities should be for the next release. My colleague wanted to focus on building out as many new features as possible, taking an aggressive approach. I felt it was more important to spend time optimizing existing features based on customer feedback first before adding too many new capabilities. Our engineering team had also recently gone through some turnover, so I thought ramping them up slowly made sense. We had an open debate about the pros and cons of each approach. Eventually, we agreed to do some compromise where we focused about 60% of the release on improvements, bug fixes and polish, while still introducing one or two carefully selected new features.",

"question": "Describe a time when you demonstrated leadership?",
"answer": "Last year, I was part of a group project in one of my classes. We had to work together to create a marketing plan for a new product launch. At first, our group was struggling to make progress because we had conflicting ideas and couldn't agree on a direction. I stepped up and suggested we split into smaller teams to research different aspects of the project, then regroup to share our findings. This helped us divide the workload more effectively. When we came back together, I facilitated a discussion to synthesize everyone's input into a cohesive plan. While it wasn't a major leadership role, I helped our group get organized and complete the project successfully."
